The overall attitude the public takes to a business on social media- one of praise or one of complaint- is quantifiable and analyzable feedback of the companies’ performance. It is a measurable indicator of the functionality of the business, revealing whether the majority of its client base is satisfied or discontented with their services.</em>

<a id="our-task" class="anchor" href="#our-task" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Task</h1>

<p><strong>Analyze text from posts on the social media sites Twitter and Facebook regarding Banks A-D.</strong> </p>

<p><em>We believe analyzing the frequent topics and sentiment of within these social media posts would provide the banks with useful consumer feedback.</em></p>

<h2>
<a id="word-frequency" class="anchor" href="#word-frequency" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>Word Frequency</em>
</h2>

<p>First, we determined the identities of the most frequently used words, and graphically represented these frequent words in word clouds and frequency plots. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Word clouds allowed for a clear and easily comprehensible visual representation of the topics addressed in social media posts. </p></li>
<li><p>Frequency plots were also included so that a numeric representation of term frequency was available, in addition to the more subjective representation of frequency seen in the word clouds. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>In each of these graphic representations, the most common topics throughout the social media text are clearly presented. Visual representations were created for the entirety of the social media text, and were then created for each of the individual banks (i.e., Banks A, B, C, and D).</em></p>

<h2>
<a id="sentiment-analysis" class="anchor" href="#sentiment-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>Sentiment Analysis</em>
</h2>

<p>To further analyze the attitude of the consumers regarding these topics, we determined the sentiment, <em>i.e</em>. the positive, negative, or neutral connotation, within the social media posts. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The neutral terms commonly included words regarding banking and financing, such as “checking” and “online.” Regarding these frequent neutral words further indicated the topics that consumers were posting about. </p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, the positive or negative frequently used terms provided feedback as to the attitudes consumers had towards the company. The sentiment scores were then plotted and graphically represented with a box chart. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Sentiment was scored on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being associated with negative sentiment and 100 being associated with positive sentiment. Neutral words did not receive a sentiment score. The sentiment scores were averaged, and these averages were represented through a bar graph. Sentiment analysis and graphical representations of same were generated for the entire dataset, as well as for each individual bank. Further, each graph compared the sentiment of frequent terms seen between two different social media sites, Twitter and Facebook</em></p>

<p>By using RStudio, we were able to write code allowing for the aforementioned analysis of the social media posts.</p>

These data suggest than Bank A is associated with exceptionally positive social media posts, while Banks B-D are associated with more negative sentiment scores below average. Overall, it would appear that there are differences- although slight- that may be seen through analyzing the positive or negative connotations of social media posts of competing businesses.</em>
